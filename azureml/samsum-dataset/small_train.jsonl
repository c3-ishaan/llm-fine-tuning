And the Louis's interpretation was that in Italy they are so nice, because they are so lowly and cannot afford to be demanding and have to be servile, basically.\r\nHenning: And in France they are arrogant, because they can afford it.\r\nHenning: Somehow, because their status is higher.\r\nMax: LOL. Another beautiful theory - nationalist in its core, after all.\r\nHenning: And I agree with neither the first nor the second assessment.\r\nMax: me neither. Being honest I don't see huge differences throughout Europe. It happens to me to meet a very nice waiter here and there, and grumpy people as well\r\nHenning: No, so far i find Italian waiters much nicer and much less professional than in Germany. But I wouldn't venture any theories about the countries.\r\nMax: Jakob (the Slovene) told me after coming back from Berlin that waiters there are so much less nice than here in Italy. While Jakob (the Pole) always complains about them being so rude in comparison with Poland.\r\nHenning: Berlin is a big city though\r\nMax: And I am starting to think that all those theories say more about their authors than about the waiters and the countries. They are always nationally framed, which is stupid\r\nHenning: Maybe. Also our position, when I am in a restaurant in Germany I am often with my family, in Italy with a bunch of fun young, foreign people.\r\nMax: Paris is a different world than Bretagne I assume. In a small village. Of course, there is more of talking, touching, joking in Italy. But people in Germany, in Landshut are also more talkative than in Munich. That's all, I believe. Aaso it depends how touristic the place is, etc.\r\nMax: It's also about the general culture of eating out, talking to waiters, anonymity of the big city. \r\nMax: Especially between societies as diverse and generally as similar as France and Italy, just think about Genova and Nice!\r\nMax: just bullshit! Luis is so communists but keeps blushing conservative and nationalist stuff.\r\nMax: And in Poland they are sometimes super nice - new American-style capitalist and servile and sometimes the \"communist\" remnants.Throwing your plate in front of you with a hostile \"prosz\u0118\" with a long accent on the hiper-correct \"\u0119\".\r\nMax: And then one is confused about his\/her judgements and builds new ones. But maybe we just don't need to read everything through this national framework. I agree that there is a lot about it, or about culture\/climate\/language\/whatever, but we just exaggerate all the time.\r\nMax: even me!
